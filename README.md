## Design

The Coffee Beans Blog was designed with coffee enthusiasts and casual readers in mind, offering a space for light and enjoyable content. 
The goal is to evoke a sense of warmth and relaxation through the use of inviting colors and easy-to-read fonts. 
The design remains clean and minimal, ensuring that users can easily focus on the content and navigate the site without distractions.

To plan the structure of the blog I made a flowchart with DrawSQL, which shows all functionality.  

![Flowchart DrawSQL](doc/read-img/ERD.png)

### Font and Colour Choices
**Fonts:** Montserrat and Roboto fonts were chosen as they are simple and easy-to-read fonts, helping the user to focus on the content.

**Colors:** The Cappuccino color palette suitable for coffee beverages was chosen from [color-hex.com](https://color-hex.com). Some shades were adapted a little
for better contrast and readability.

**Images:** All images were taken from [pexels.com](https://www.pexels.com/) 

# Agile
I used the Projects tool within GitHub to manage the different processes needed for this project to be completed. At the beginning, a Project titled "Coffee_Beans_Board" was created on GitHub and linked to the Coffee beans blog repository. 
This Coffee beans Blog Project was used to keep track of the user stories and can be found here [here](https://github.com/users/mufasa1611/projects/9/).

In total, there were 16 user stories, of which 9 with the label "must have" were moved throughout the development cycle from "To Do" to "In Progress" to "Done". 
When I initially created the issues, I did not use any particular order to write down my ideas, so there are a number of issues that
became invalid or had to be modified when my project objectives changed over time. A few became obsolete, which I deleted from the board. With my next project I plan to be more organized. I think Agile technology is a very valuable tool, that needs to be implemented and followed through to keep up with the project deadlines and to keep track
of the most important features that need to be implemented in a given time-frame.

Details about the individual user stories, their associated Acceptance Criteria, Tasks, Labels and Epics can be found under the respective links:<br>

### Possible Future Features
   - a share posts function, so the user can share their favorite blogs with their contacts on social media
   - logged-in users could publish their own blog posts so they can interact and exchange views with the online community
   - the site owners should be able to mark their blog posts with different categories, which would enhance UX for the users
   - add a search function, so the user can search by category, species and/or origin to find posts that interest them faster
   - 404 and 500 Error Page: Enhance UX by customizing the 404 and 500 error page to provide meaningful feedback on what went wrong.

## Testing
A comprehensive report on testing and de-bugging for this project can be found [here](testing.md).

## Deployment

The repository was created on GitHub.

The code was edited locally on visual basic studio and then pushed to GitHub using the sequence: 
"git add ." --> "git commit -m "..."" --> "git push"

This site was then deployed on Heroku:
- In Heroku, on my dashboard, I clicked "New" and then "Create new app"
- I named the app, set the region to "Europe" and then clicked "Create app".
- In the "Settings tab", I added the necessary Config Vars "CLOUDINARY_URL", "DATABASE_URL", and "SECRET_KEY" with their respective values, and clicked "Add"
- In the deploy tab, I selected "GitHub" as deployment method, searched for my project, and connected the app to it.
- I deployed the site by choosing "Manual deploy."
